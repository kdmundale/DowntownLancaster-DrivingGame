HELLO!

This is a simple JavaScript driving game created as a first semester project for the Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology Computer Software Engineering program.

I created this game with the help of a partner, but have made changes since and hope to continue to develop the game for mobile devices as well.

as of 7-22-2020 i have been able to make it compatible for touch screen devices, although there are some bugs to work out!!
